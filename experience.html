        Despite the fact that I am an introvert, I saw a significant improvement in the quality of my social life after 
        I started attending high school. At SMKA Sultan Muhammad, I began to take risks. The first challenge I have to overcome is a competition in marching. I have been involved in a variety of different marching activities ever since I was in the third grade. 
        There are several honours that have been conferred upon me, including:
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>JOHAN KAWAD KREATIF PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
            <li>JOHAN KAWAD KAKI PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
            <li>JOHAN BRAIN AND BRAWL PERINGKAT DAERAH</li>
            <li>NAIB JOHAN KAWAD KAKI BOMBA PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
            <li>NAIB JOHAN KAWAD KAKI KASPA PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
        </ul>
    
        Not only that, but also participate in the performance marching at

        </ol>

        Because of this, I made the decision to become a member of the campus's komander kesatria in order to 
        improve my sense of self-worth and get more knowledge on how to respond appropriately when confronted with
         potentially risky situations. 
        In addition to that, I was able to direct a programme and lead a group.
         The following are examples of some of the tasks that fall under my purview:
        <br>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>CONQUEROR THE TOP:PUBGM</li>
            <li>MISI PASCA BANJIR</li>
            <li>KEM KEMPIMPINAN KOMANDER KESATRIA</li>
            <li>ESCAPE ROOM 4.O</li>
            <li>EXCAPADE ART STREET</li>
            <li>LAWATAN KE ARKIB NEGARA</li>

        </ol>
