            <br> 
            <br>
            When I was 5 years old, I enrolled in <a href="https://www.lookp.com/tabika-kemas-kampung-tengah-bukit-rambai?review=show_more#results">Tadika Kemas Bukit Rambai</a> and continued my education there until I was 6 years old.
            After that, I moved on to <a href="https://www.apac.com.my/mba2023-sk-bukit-rambai.html">Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Rambai</a> and completed classes 1 through 6 there. 
            At the Sekolah Rendah Agama Jaim Bukit Rambai, where I performed my evening studies,
            I was able to get a <b>5A</b> in <em>UPSR</em> and an <b>8A</b> in <em>UPKK</em> with the assistance of Allah. 
            Both of these grades were awarded by the school. Following that, I spent form 1 through 5 at 
            <a href="http://smkasultanmuhammad.weebly.com/">Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama Sultan Muhammad</a>. I'm giving myself a challenge by 
            staying away from home and at a hostel instead. My time at SMKA Sultan Muhammad was responsible for
            the bulk of my formal education. On the <em>PT3</em>, I was graded with a <b>7A</b>, however on the <em>SPM</em>, I was only given a <b>6A</b>. 
            I was able to gain admission at <a href="https://nsembilan.uitm.edu.my/rembau/#">UITM Kampus Rembau</a>  due to the quality of my previous studies,
            and I am currently in the last semester of the Diploma in Information Management course.

                Despite the fact that I am an introvert, I saw a significant improvement in the quality of my social life after 
                I started attending high school. At SMKA Sultan Muhammad, I began to take risks. The first challenge I have to overcome is a competition in marching. I have been involved in a variety of different marching activities ever since I was in the third grade. 
                There are several honours that have been conferred upon me, including:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>JOHAN KAWAD KREATIF PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
                    <li>JOHAN KAWAD KAKI PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
                    <li>JOHAN BRAIN AND BRAWL PERINGKAT DAERAH</li>
                    <li>NAIB JOHAN KAWAD KAKI BOMBA PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
                    <li>NAIB JOHAN KAWAD KAKI KASPA PERINGKAT KEBANGSAAN</li>
                </ul>
            
                Not only that, but also participate in the performance marching at
                <ol>

                </ol>
                <br>
                Because of this, I made the decision to become a member of the campus's komander kesatria in order to 
                improve my sense of self-worth and get more knowledge on how to respond appropriately when confronted with
                 potentially risky situations. 
                In addition to that, I was able to direct a programme and lead a group.
                 The following are examples of some of the tasks that fall under my purview:
