    When I was 5 years old, I enrolled in <a href="https://www.lookp.com/tabika-kemas-kampung-tengah-bukit-rambai?review=show_more#results">Tadika Kemas Bukit Rambai</a> and continued my education there until I was 6 years old.
    After that, I moved on to <a href="https://www.apac.com.my/mba2023-sk-bukit-rambai.html">Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Rambai</a> and completed classes 1 through 6 there. 
    At the Sekolah Rendah Agama Jaim Bukit Rambai, where I performed my evening studies,
    I was able to get a <b>5A</b> in <em>UPSR</em> and an <b>8A</b> in <em>UPKK</em> with the assistance of Allah. 
    Both of these grades were awarded by the school. Following that, I spent form 1 through 5 at 
    <a href="http://smkasultanmuhammad.weebly.com/">Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama Sultan Muhammad</a>. I'm giving myself a challenge by 
    staying away from home and at a hostel instead. My time at SMKA Sultan Muhammad was responsible for
    the bulk of my formal education. On the <em>PT3</em>, I was graded with a <b>7A</b>, however on the <em>SPM</em>, I was only given a <b>6A</b>. 
    I was able to gain admission at <a href="https://nsembilan.uitm.edu.my/rembau/#">UITM Kampus Rembau</a>  due to the quality of my previous studies,
    and I am currently in the last semester of the Diploma in Information Management course.
